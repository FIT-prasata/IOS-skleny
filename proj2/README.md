# Project 2

evaulation: 15/15

Dihydrogen oxide synthesis process synchronization program.
This project has to learn us how to create, manage and use multiprocessed programs. It's written in C. Assignment is heavily inspired by book *The Little Book of Semaphores*, Oxygen, hydrogen water molecule creating problem. It's upgraded only by additional printing.

The Little Book of Semaphores is in [this repository](https://github.com/ondryaso/leoAtFit/tree/master/2.%20semestr/IOS)

## How to run
1. compile with command make
2. run example: ./proj2 4 5 100 100
- 4 is a number of oxygens
- 5 is a number of hydrogens
- rest is waiting time in miliseconds used to simulate creation of molecules
